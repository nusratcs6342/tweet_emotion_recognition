# tweet_emotion_recognition
Humans have such a wide range of emotions and they can express their emotions through various methods. Writing is one of them, however by the reign of social media now people like to express their emotions on social media. In this research effort we used 6 emotions Sadness, Joy, Anger, Fear, and Surprise. We used multiple models and trained each model with 16000 training data and tested with 2000 test data. 

Three deep learning models—Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—are being used in this study.  The outcomes show how well the models that were put into use work for identifying tweet emotions. The accuracy of the Bidirectional GRU model is 91.85%, whereas the accuracy of the CNN model is somewhat higher at 91.95%. With an accuracy of 88.50%, the LSTM model performs admirably. To learn more about the classification skills of the models, evaluation measures including confusion matrix, f-1 scores, precision, recall, and ROC AUC scores are used.

By comparing the Bidirectional GRU, CNN, and LSTM models on the Hugging Face Emotion dataset, this effort makes a contribution to the field of twitter emotion identification. In order to choose the best models for their applications, researchers and practitioners can benefit greatly from the findings. As a foundation for future study and advancements in sentiment analysis and social media analytics, the assessment metrics and analysis offered here.

Overall, the research effort shows how well Bidirectional GRU, CNN, and LSTM models recognize tweet emotions. The results expand sentiment analysis and offer helpful recommendations for social networking analytics applications.
